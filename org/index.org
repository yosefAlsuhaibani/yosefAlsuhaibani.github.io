* Hej!

Hello, I am Yosef (he/him). I like expensive clothes and a proper hike.

* Computercode & technologie (in french)

I work at [[https:semgrep.dev][semgrepdotdev]], and I mainly write functional code (OCaml)
& functional code (It kinda works you just gotta finagle it sometimes). I did a
bunch of things in programming langauges/formal methods in college, and it is
what im interested in.
